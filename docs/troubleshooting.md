# Troubleshooting

## My steppers are running backwards!
Refer to the stepper section at the top of printer.cfg, you can add or remove `!` in front of the dir_pin to reverse the direction of that particular stepper.

## Everytime i update my changes are gone.
You're not supposed to change *any* files inside the config/ folder. You should *only* change your printer.cfg, if you need to change settings refer to the [Configuration: overrides](configuration.md#overrides) section.
