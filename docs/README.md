# Introduction
V-CoreOS is a preconfigured software package for the Rat Rig V-Core 3, that aims to make it as painless as possible to get [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker) and [Fluidd](https://docs.fluidd.xyz/) up and running on your printer. It is developed and maintained by Mikkel Schmidt (miklschmidt#2036 on the Rat Rig Unofficial Discord).

To run V-CoreOS on your V-Core 3 you need a supported control board and a Raspberry Pi.

# Software Credits

V-CoreOS is based on [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker), [Fluidd](https://docs.fluidd.xyz/), [MainsailOS](https://github.com/raymondh2/MainsailOS) and [FluiddPi](https://github.com/cadriel/FluiddPI), without these and the amazing people behind them, V-CoreOS would not have been possible.
