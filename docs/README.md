# Introduction

RatOS is a preconfigured Raspberry Pi image that aims to make it as painless as possible to get [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Mainsail](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/) and [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/) up and running on your printer. It is developed and maintained by Mikkel Schmidt (miklschmidt#2036 on the Rat Rig Unofficial Discord).

To run RatOS on your printer you need a supported control board and a Raspberry Pi.

# Software Credits

RatOS is based on [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Moonraker](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Mainsail](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/), [MainsailOS](https://github.com/raymondh2/MainsailOS) and [KlipperScreen](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/) without these and the amazing people behind them, RatOS would not have been possible.
