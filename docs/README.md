# Introduction
V-CoreOS is a preconfigured software package for the Rat Rig V-Core 3, that aims to make it as painless as possible to get Klipper, Fluidd and Moonraker up and running on your printer. It is developed and maintained by Mikkel Schmidt (miklschmidt#2036 on the Rat Rig Unofficial Discord).

To run V-CoreOS on your V-Core 3 you need a supported control board and a Raspberry Pi. The initial configuration is made to work with the official [SKR Pro 1.2 Wiring Diagram](https://v-core.ratrig.com/electronics/#skr-pro-12).

# Software Credits

V-CoreOS is based on [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/), [Fluidd](https://docs.fluidd.xyz/), [MainsailOS](https://github.com/raymondh2/MainsailOS) and [FluiddPi](https://github.com/cadriel/FluiddPI), without these and the amazing people behind them, V-CoreOS would not have been possible.
